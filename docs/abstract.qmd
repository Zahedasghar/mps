title: "Words of the SBP: Text Analysis of Monetary Policy Statements"
---
In era of ML, AI and NLP, text analysis is becoming more and more important as human may miss some important information and computer-based approaches can process and summarise text more efficiently than humans. Also, textual analysis may extract meaning from text missed by human readers, who may overlook certain patterns because they do not conform to prior beliefs and expectations (Herasymova, 2022). There are many studies which have done in detail textual analysis of central bank statements.With this motivation, I do textual analysis to monetary policy statements by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) which is aimed at understanding the monetary policy stance of the central bank.
