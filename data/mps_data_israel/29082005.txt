This decision is based on the assessment that the present level of the Bank of Israel interest rate is consistent with an inflation rate expected to be close to 2 percent––the midpoint of the government's price-stability target of between 1 percent and 3 percent inflation a year. 
Nevertheless, it is noted that information received recently points to the possibility of the creation of forces that would boost inflation, and therefore necessitates a continued meticulous review of economic developments and the rate of interest:
First, the rise in the CPI in July exceeded expectations. At this stage it is premature to determine to what extent this reflects a boost to the inflationary process. The picture regarding inflation will become clearer when additional information on the development of prices is published. Second, the level of economic activity was found to significantly higher than had been estimated for the last eight quarters. The more the output gap (the gap between potential and actual growth) contracts, the greater the chances of a continued rise in inflation. Third, assessments that the interest rate in the US will continue to rise to levels higher than previously expected have become firmer. Fourth, special attention must be paid to the possible implications for prices in Israel of the persistent rises in world oil prices. Fifth, it appears that political uncertainty has risen, which is likely to lead to economic uncertainty.
The Bank of Israel will not hesitate to change the interest rate if the information received from the financial markets and from other sources indicate a rise in the rate of inflation to above the target set by the government. This would be done to achieve the government's inflation target and thereby to support the whole range of objectives of macroeconomic policy.
