This decision is based on the assessment that in the current circumstances the present level of nominal short-term interest is consistent with an inflation rate close to the midpoint of the government's price-stability target of between 1 percent and 3 percent in annual terms, over time. This conclusion is based on data derived from the capital market, the predictions of various economic forecasters, and the economic models and analysis of the Bank of Israel.
The recent rise in the NIS $ exchange rate, against the background of the changes in foreign currency markets around the world, has occurred so far alongside continued financial stability, and has not resulted in revised assessments regarding future inflation vis-Ã -vis the target. This is the backdrop against which interest policy is under constant review in the light of current developments, with the intention of achieving the government's inflation target.
