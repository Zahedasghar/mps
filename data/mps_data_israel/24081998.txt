The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for September, according to which the interest rate will remain unchanged at a nominal level of 9.5 percent.
The Bank of Israel clarified that this decision was made in light of the assessment regarding the development of the inflation environment, the means of payment, and other developments, such as real economic activity and the path of foreign prices, after the reduction of the payment and other developments such as real economic activity and the path of prices abroad. This follows a cumulative interest rate cut of 3.9 percentage points since the beginning of the year (which includes the last reduction of 1.5 percentage points) and 7.5 percentage points since mid-1996.
The Bank of Israel reiterates that the narrowing of interest-rate differentials between the shekel and foreign currencies and the high volatility and uncertainty prevailing in the world's money and capital markets, against the background of the instability in the financial markets in East Asia, Russia and Latin America, This policy, after a long period of interest-rate cuts, is needed to support the achievement of the inflation target of 4 percent set by the government for 1999.
The Bank of Israel notes that a responsible monetary policy that acts consistently to achieve the inflation targets until achieving long-term price stability, in accordance with the decisions of the government, also contributes most effectively to achieving its other economic goals - including progress towards realizing the economy's growth potential. This progress is the basis for the correct and stable solution to the unemployment problem, which is now a major social and economic problem. The importance of achieving economic stability, inter alia, through strict adherence to budgetary discipline, increased in light of the integration of the Israeli economy into the process of globalization, especially after the significant progress in the liberalization of the foreign exchange market.
