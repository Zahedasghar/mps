The Bank of Israel explains that the decision to reduce the interest rate at this rate is intended to consolidate the continued progress achieved in the area of ​​inflation, expressed, inter alia, by the development of actual inflation, indicators of its future development, and the rate of growth of the money supply. Price developments since December 1998 followed the interest rate hike last November, in view of the sharp depreciation recorded in the shekel, against the background of the shocks in global financial markets. However, the Bank of Israel notes that the exceptionally low rate of price increases since December last year, which was made possible by the policy adopted, is partly a correction to the exceptional price increase recorded in September-November last year. In this context, the Bank of Israel noted that the various forecasts for the development of inflation in the next 12 months are still higher than 4%, a rate consistent with the 1999 inflation target.
The Bank of Israel stresses that it is now important to adopt a responsible wage policy consistent with the budget framework, and supports the economic strategy aimed at creating a macroeconomic framework that strengthens the economy's resilience and stability.
The Bank of Israel notes that during this period of high uncertainty in the economy and in the financial markets, it is particularly important that economic policy be taken into account to resume growth to a sustainable level. This will provide the right solution to the problem of unemployment. This policy will also help improve profitability in the business sector.
