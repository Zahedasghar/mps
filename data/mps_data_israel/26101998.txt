The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for November, according to which the Bank of Israel interest rate will increase by 2 percentage points to 11.5 percent.
The Bank of Israel explained that this decision was made in light of the need and commitment of monetary policy to preserve and ensure stability conditions, against the background of the shocks that are taking place in the global financial markets and which are reflected recently in the capital market and foreign currency in Israel. These shocks contributed recently to the sharp and rapid devaluation of the shekel, followed by a rapid rise in price indices and inflation expectations. The interest rate hike is required in advance to prevent the translation of these developments and the expected rise in the CPI for October, which will be published next month, to rapid inflation, erosion of real depreciation and destabilization of the economy.
The Bank of Israel noted that in order for the rapid devaluation of the shekel not to cause a higher rate of inflation and to destabilize the economy in light of the relatively rapid expansion of the money supply, a consistent and reliable macroeconomic policy is required to restore the stability conditions necessary for the proper functioning of the financial markets Growth. Within this framework, the Bank of Israel continues to act to achieve the inflation target of 4% for 1999, as determined by the Government.
The Bank of Israel emphasized that under the current circumstances, direct and prolonged intervention by the Bank of Israel in determining the daily exchange rate through purchases and sales of foreign currency will not be effective and can not substitute for the interest rate policy necessary to achieve the inflation target.
The Bank of Israel further emphasized that in order to ensure the macroeconomic framework that is essential for creating the conditions of economic stability necessary for the creation of sustainable growth, a consistent budgetary policy is required in line with the deficit target of 2 percent of GDP in 1999.
