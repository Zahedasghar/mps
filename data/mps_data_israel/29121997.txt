The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for January 1998, according to which the interest rate will remain unchanged.
This decision is consistent with the continued lowering of inflation in 1998 within the target range set by the government (7-10 percent). The government decided to continue reducing inflation in 1998 as part of a multi-year strategy to reduce it to the level prevailing in developed countries until the beginning of the next decade, and to continue to strive for price stability over time.
The Bank of Israel made it clear that continued reduction of inflation in Israel will help the Israeli economy to embark on a path of sustained growth. The importance of reducing inflation increases with the decline in global inflation and with the intensification of globalization processes and increased competitiveness. The Bank of Israel emphasized that achieving the desired rate of growth, in accordance with the economy's potential, requires maintaining budgetary discipline in accordance with the government's decision on the framework of the budget deficit, while avoiding raising taxes. It is also important that the wage agreements that will be signed soon in the public sector be consistent with the inflation targets and the achievement of stability.
The Bank of Israel explains that the recent volatility in the world's money and capital markets and the economic crises in Asia require extra caution in the management of the budget and interest policy.
Monetary policy works successfully to achieve the government's inflation targets and to achieve price stability over time, thus contributing most effectively to achieving the other goals set by the government - including progress towards achieving the economy's growth potential in order to achieve sustainable growth and create jobs.
