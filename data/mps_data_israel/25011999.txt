The Bank of Israel explained that the decision was intended to strengthen and ensure economic stability, including the establishment of progress in the convergence process of the inflation environment to 4 percent, a level consistent with the inflation target set by the government for 1999. This inflation environment prevailed in 1998, (Between September and November), which stemmed mainly from the global financial shocks, reflected in the sharp devaluation of the shekel against foreign currencies. The return of the inflation environment to its previous level and the containment of price increases of recent months, which threatened to accelerate inflation, were made possible by the interest rate policy adopted without the need for direct intervention in the foreign currency market.
The successful integration of the Israeli economy into the process of globalization with the economies of the world requires strengthening the commitment of economic policy to achieving stability, in accordance with the economic goals of the government. In addition, the Bank of Israel emphasizes that the need for a responsible monetary policy is particularly strong in the current situation, in view of the uncertainty that prevails in the global financial markets and the uncertainty surrounding the budget policy during this period - both regarding the approval of the budget and its framework and composition. Moreover, given the implications of the wage policy on the state budget and the inflationary pressures on the economy, it is important to adopt a wage policy that is equivalent to the public sector, which will be consistent with the stability goals.
The Bank of Israel stresses that the resumption of growth - which is the real solution to the unemployment problem - requires the urgent approval of the budget and the Arrangements Law by the Knesset, without deviations from the framework approved by the government, while maintaining a budget that reflects the necessary economic priorities.
