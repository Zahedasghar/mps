This decision is based on the assessment that in the current circumstances the present level of the Bank of Israel interest rate is consistent with an inflation rate expected to be close to the midpoint of the government's price-stability target of between 1 percent and 3 percent inflation a year. 
Regarding the factors which could affect assessments of inflation in the future, the Bank notes that (1) the effect of the recent depreciation of the NIS on the future path of inflation is to increase the probability that inflation will remain close to the midpoint of the target, as it seems that prices will rise faster in the second half of the year than they did in the first. (2) The rate of expansion of real economic activity does not appear to carry with it the threat of inflationary pressures that could endanger the achievement of the price-stability target. (3) Fiscal discipline has gained the public's confidence and is reflected in lower yields in the bond market than in the past, and contributes to economic stability. (4) Developments in the global markets, including changes expected in interest rates and rises in oil prices, have not affected inflation expectations, which are within the target range. (5) Although uncertainty with regard to the economic implications of possible geopolitical developments has risen, it has not led to a change in assessments of future inflation.
The Bank of Israel will continue to keep its interest-rate policy under constant review, with the aim of achieving the inflation target set by the government and of avoiding deviations from it, both upward and downward, and of supporting the whole range of objectives of macroeconomic policy.
