All the indicators suggest that with a view one and two years forward, the present level of nominal short-term interest, under the current circumstances, is consistent with an inflation rate of about 2 percent, around the midpoint of the government's price-stability target of between 1 percent and 3 percent in annual terms, over time. This is the conclusion derived from the inflation expectations calculated from the capital market, from the predictions of various private forecasters, from the economic models used by the Bank of Israel, and from the responses of about 500 companies that participate in the Bank's Companies Survey, with almost 85 percent of them expecting inflation in the next twelve months to be within the price-stability target range.
The Bank of Israel's policy of maintaining price stability at the current level of interest under the prevailing circumstances is supported, inter alia, by the continuing stability of the capital and foreign-currency markets, and by the relatively low level of uncertainty in the economy. This interest policy, one expression of which is the expected rate of short-term real interest of about 1.6 percent, supports the continued recovery of real economic activity in the long run. In this context the Bank's assessment for 2005 should be borne in mind that GDP will rise by about 4 percent, that business-sector product will rise by about 5 percent, and that unemployment will continue falling.
Although the risk premium of some emerging markets has risen, Israel's has remained low, a further reflection of the notable stability from which the domestic financial markets, including the foreign-currency market, are benefiting. The stability of the exchange rate in Israel has been preserved and has even surpassed that of many other countries the financial risk of Israel's economy is low and has even declined slightly medium- and long-term yields––to 10 and 20 years––are steady medium- and long-term inflation expectations––up to 10 years––are within the price-stability target range the share of CPI-indexed assets in the public's asset portfolio is on a downward path and the share of long-term assets in the total of local-currency unindexed assets is rising.
