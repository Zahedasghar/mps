The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for July, according to which the Bank of Israel interest rate will be reduced by 0.3 percentage points. After this decline in interest rates, the rate of the reduction since the beginning of the year was 2.1 percentage points, and since the middle of 1996, by 5.7 percentage points.
The Bank of Israel clarified that this decision was made in view of the progress in reducing the inflation environment, expressed, among other things, by the actual rate of inflation, expectations regarding its future development, and the development of the money supply. The assessment of the effect of other factors on the inflation environment, such as real economic activity and the development of prices abroad, was also behind the decision to reduce the interest rate.
The Bank of Israel further noted that in order to consolidate the process of lowering inflation and against the background of the financial crises in East Asia, which led to considerable uncertainty in the world's money and capital markets, further caution is required in operating the interest rate policy. This is especially the case against the background of the narrowing of the interest-rate differentials between the shekel and foreign currencies. This caution is reflected, inter alia, in a high real interest rate, relative to the past.
The Bank of Israel notes that a responsible monetary policy that consistently works to reduce inflation until long-term stability is achieved also contributes most effectively to achieving the other economic targets set by the government, including progress towards realizing the economy's growth potential. In addition, the importance of achieving economic stability, which includes strict observance of fiscal discipline, is increasing as the Israeli economy becomes integrated into the process of globalization, especially after significant progress in the liberalization of the foreign exchange market.
