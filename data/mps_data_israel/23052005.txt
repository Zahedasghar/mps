The present level of nominal short-term interest is consistent with an inflation rate close to the midpoint of the government's price-stability target of between 1 percent and 3 percent in annual terms, over time. This is the conclusion derived from the range of indicators regarding expected inflation over the next one and two years: inflation expectations calculated from the capital market, the predictions of various economic forecasters, and the economic models used by the Bank of Israel.
These assessments of expected inflation are supported by several indicators pointing to continued stability in the capital and foreign-currency markets: exchangeâ€“rate stability and expectations in the financial markets that it will persist the continued decline of yields in the government-bond market and Israel's very low and stable risk premium. Concurrently the dollar interest rate is rising, and the differential between it and the NIS interest rate is contracting.
